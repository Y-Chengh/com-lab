program → block
block → { decls stmts }
decls → decls delc | ε
delc → type id ;
type → type [ num ] | basic
basic → int | char | float | String
stmts → stmts stmt | ε 
stmt → loc = bool ; | if ( bool ) stmt | if ( bool ) stmt else stmt | while ( bool ) stmt | do stmt while ( bool ) ; | break ; | bolck
loc → loc [ bool ] | id
bool → bool or join | join
join → join and equality | equality
equality → equality == rel | equality != rel | rel
rel → expr < expr | expr <= expr | expr >= expr | expr > expr | expr
expr → expr + term | expr - term | term
term → term * unary | term / unary | unary
unary → ! unary | factor
factor → ( bool ) | loc | num | real | true | false
